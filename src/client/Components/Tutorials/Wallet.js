          2) Setup Your Wallet on MetaMask
        </div>
        <div className="text-s margin-top-s">
          Go through the setup process on MetaMask. It will ask you to write
          down 12 words and keep it in a safe place - it is HIGHLY recommended
          to do this as this is your password and access key. You can use these
          12 words to share the same wallet account on both browser and mobile
          app.
          <br />
          <br />
          The best way to ensure you won't lose your password is to write down
          these 12 words and give it to a family member or friend who you trust
          with your life as a backup in case you lose yours.

        <div className="text-s margin-top-s">
          When you use an Ethereum app (decentralized app / dApp), the site may
          prompt you verify an action that you do, such as logging in or sending
          a transaction. All of these prompts will ask you, through MetaMask, to
          sign the action which verifies that you are physical owner of the
          keys.

          4) Fund Your MetaMask Wallet (Optional)
        </div>
        <div className="text-s margin-top-s">
          To mint, transfer, or exchange an NFT or currency (i.e. a
          transaction), it will cost a fee to use the network. This fee is
          called "gas" on Ethereum in which you pay using the crypto currency
          Ether (ETH). In your wallet, you will see a deposit address (e.g.
          0x777Bc2a...) in your MetaMask.
          <br />
          <br />
          Purchase ETH on a crypto currency exchange, such as Coinbase, Gemini
          or Binance, and withdraw to this deposit address.
