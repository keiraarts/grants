We do not have custody and all NFTs are minted directly from the artist's verified wallet. That being said, centralization is important to the extent\n              that it makes sense, and our curation tooling and website are parts of the platform that we control and update. It is currently too difficult to operate this all on decentralized \n              services but we will migrate when it is possible."}),r.createElement(o,{title:"Where are the NFT's art assets stored?",text:"We believe in asset permanence, and that all artworks should live forever.

It is the reason Sevens Foundation was created, to allow a launchpad\n              for people who hesitate or cannot afford to make such a large investment in themselves when they surely should, even with this given landscape. But scaling solutions on Ethereum are coming, and they are\n              coming fast. This is a temporary problem that will be resolved in which we will migrate and upgrade when the time is right."}),r.createElement(o,{title:"The environmental impacts are not acceptable?",text:"No they are not, and we are committed to reducing carbon footprint as an organization. However, \n              traditional infrastructure and servers - for example the existing banking systems - are just as wasteful and more. This is definitely not to be an excuse for carbon emissions, \n              but fortunately Ethereum will eventually migrate to a different security mechanism that will reduce emissions by 99%.
