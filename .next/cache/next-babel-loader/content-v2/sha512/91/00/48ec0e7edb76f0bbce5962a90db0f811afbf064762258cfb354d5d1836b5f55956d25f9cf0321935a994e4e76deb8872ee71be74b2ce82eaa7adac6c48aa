We believe the negative stigma towards NFTs is blown out of proportion \n              in a way that does not capture the larger picture of how our world is currently operating.`}\n        />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"text-l text-b margin-top\">\n        <strong>Resources</strong>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"text-s margin-top-s\">Learn more about NFTs</div>\n      <div className=\"page-container text-m\">\n        <a\n          target={\"_blank\"}\n          href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8ww4aNlPQU\"\n          className=\"text-grey pointer margin-top\"\n        >\n          Mankind's \"What is an NFT?\"\n        </a>\n        <br />\n        <a\n          target={\"_blank\"}\n          href=\"https://www.loop-news.com/p/beginners-guide-crypto-art-and-nfts\"\n          className=\"text-grey pointer margin-top\"\n        >\n          Loopify's Beginners Guide\n        </a>\n        <br />\n        <a\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          href=\"https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/PF42Z9oE_r6yhZN9jZrrseXfHaZALj9JIfMplshlgQ0\"\n          className=\"text-grey pointer margin-top\"\n        >\n          Coopahtroopa's NFT Landscape\n        </a>\n        <br />\n        <a\n          className=\"text-grey pointer margin-top\"\n          href=\"https://parishilton.com/why-im-excited-about-nfts/\"\n        >\n          Paris Hilton's \"I'm Excited About NFTs—You Should Be Too\"\n        </a>\n        <br />\n        <a\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          href=\"/tutorial\"\n          className=\"text-grey remove-a margin-top\"\n        >\n          Setting up a wallet\n        </a>\n        <br />\n        <a\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          href=\"/opensea\"\n          className=\"text-grey remove-a margin-top\"\n        >\n          Minting on OpenSea\n        </a>\n        <br />\n        <a\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          href=\"/rarible\"\n          className=\"text-grey remove-a margin-top\"\n        >\n          Minting on Rarible\n        </a>\n        <br />\n        <a\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          href=\"https://discord.gg/a9dDyUCZWY\"\n          className=\"text-grey pointer margin-top\"\n        >\n          Maalavidaa's Artist Mental Health Community\n        </a>\n        <br />\n        <a\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          className=\"text-grey pointer margin-top\"\n          href=\"https://goldstandard.org\"\n        >\n          Reducing Carbon Footprint\n        </a>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nconst Block = ({ title, text }) => {\n  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"margin-top\">\n      <div\n        className=\"flex pointer faq-title-container\"\n        onClick={() => setOpen(!open)}\n      >\n        <div className=\"text-m flex-full faq-title\">{title}</div>\n        <img\n          src={open ? `/assets/up.png` : `/assets/down.png`}\n          className=\"faq-toggle\"\n        />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"line-spacer\" />\n      {open && <div className=\"text-s margin-top-s\">{text}</div>}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
