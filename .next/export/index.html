Since starring in ‚ÄúThe Simple Life,‚Äù Hilton has built a global empire as an influencer, DJ, designer, recording artist, philanthropist, host, actress, model and author. \n\nSince the debut of her critically-acclaimed YouTube Originals documentary ‚ÄúThis Is Paris‚Äù, Paris has used her voice and dedicated her platform and resources to supporting Breaking Code Silence, the organization created to affect change in the Troubled Teen industry and to eradicate the abuse of children in systemically abusive institutions.\n\nIn 2020, she was accepted to RISE Justice Labs, the world‚Äôs first civil rights accelerator to continue her advocacy work around the Troubled Teen Industry. Her documentary served as the catalyst to generate awareness and support for these efforts. Paris collaborated with Utah senator resulting in Bill 127 being voted into legislation in Utah requiring tighter regulation of congregate youth care facilities. Paris is now taking on legislation reform at the federal level.\n\nAlways attuned to emerging trends and opportunities, Hilton continues to expand Paris Hilton Entertainment into a leading global integrated media and product company, leveraging digital, audio, television, and social. She is focused on using her platform to inspire, empower and create lasting positive impact.  As an investor, Hilton is committed to supporting and investing in the next generation of entrepreneurs positively impacting the world at companies such as Daily Harvest, R3SET, Good Catch, Zen Water, and many more.\n\nPhilanthropy is an important part of Hilton‚Äôs life. She has been passionately involved with numerous philanthropic organizations, including Children‚Äôs Hospital, Starlight Children‚Äôs Foundation, American Humane Association, and most recently The Sasha Project LA, among others.","email":"sevensexhibit@pheholdings.com","website":"https://parishilton.com","twitter":"parishilton","instagram":"parishiltonnft","__v":0,"logo":"62780ac13bcd63fb4030c8ce17cc40e879f5106a.png","id":"607a16e91455a806c582a771"}],"exhibiting":false,"total":0,"_id":"607a16e91455a806c582a772","name":"Empowered By Paris: Empowered Women Empower Women","url":"empowering-women-artists","description":"I am so happy to be involved with the Sevens Foundation, which helps emerging artists get into the NFT space.

There are so many talented female artists that I admire and have discovered in my own journey, so I invite you all to be part of a women's only NFT art show!\n\nCalling on female artists to create a piece that explores the themes of female empowerment and representation. These past few years have been a critical time of awakening and important awareness of deeply embedded cultural injustices toward women. With this comes an opportunity for women to not only seek well-deserved recognition and opportunity but also to be empowered and have our voices be heard. There is a beauty and strength in the female perspective and that should be celebrated!\n\nWith the Sevens Foundation, this exhibit will be one step in elevating and empowering female artists across the world.
