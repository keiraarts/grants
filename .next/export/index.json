Her documentary served as the catalyst to generate awareness and support for these efforts. Paris collaborated with Utah senator resulting in Bill 127 being voted into legislation in Utah requiring tighter regulation of congregate youth care facilities. Paris is now taking on legislation reform at the federal level.\n\nAlways attuned to emerging trends and opportunities, Hilton continues to expand Paris Hilton Entertainment into a leading global integrated media and product company, leveraging digital, audio, television, and social.

It’s been so exciting to see the digital art world evolve and become more prominent with the rise of the NFT marketplace -- it’s truly an incredible time for artists and creators. It’s also an important time to ensure that female artists get to succeed with equal representation and opportunities. There are so many talented female artists that I admire and have discovered in my own journey, so I invite you all to be part of a women's only NFT art show!\n\nCalling on female artists to create a piece that explores the themes of female empowerment and representation. These past few years have been a critical time of awakening and important awareness of deeply embedded cultural injustices toward women. With this comes an opportunity for women to not only seek well-deserved recognition and opportunity but also to be empowered and have our voices be heard. There is a beauty and strength in the female perspective and that should be celebrated!\n\nWith the Sevens Foundation, this exhibit will be one step in elevating and empowering female artists across the world. I’m thrilled to be a part of this wonderful community and hope to help shape it in a positive way.","close":"2021-05-10T07:00:25.000Z","open":"2021-04-18T16:00:46.000Z","id":"607a16e91455a806c582a772"},{"organizers":[{"admins":["6035e7415f0a684942f4e17c"],"active":false,"_id":"605f948be26eb64b749bbc08","name":"Sevens Foundation","url":"sevens-foundation","about":"Sevens was founded under the premise of giving back to the community in which we quickly evolved to understand how important the integrity of this creative space is for our collective future.

This shifts the power dynamic away from potential corruption due to centralized authority and creates more fairness and transparency for all. But, some magnitude of centralization is beneficial in its own ways - what are the tradeoffs?\n\nAdditionally, we invite the community to be a curator for the exhibition by voting on submitted artworks.

Artist Collective are working on a debut exhibition to showcase original works of art centered around the theme of Distorted Reality. \n\nAs artists, we rely on our perception of the world around us to inspire our work, but what if that instinct isn’t reliable? How can we challenge the notion of what is even real?  Reality can be brought into question in countless ways, something as simple as an illusion or trick of the eye, or as complex as misinterpreting what is around us through distorted or irrational thoughts. During the pandemic, our sense of time and human interaction has also been thrown off due to isolation, and we have been forced to rely on technology to connect with one another, altering the reality most of us participated in just a year ago. This exhibition challenges artists to explore the concept of reality and the many ways that humans distort it due to circumstances, mental health, personal or global perceptions.","tagline":"This exhibition challenges artists to explore the concept of reality and the many ways that humans distort it due to circumstances, mental health, personal or global perceptions.","open":"2021-04-12T14:00:39.000Z","close":"2021-05-11T05:00:09.000Z","id":"6070ea37982e298b11fe062b"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
