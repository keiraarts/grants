          'Work' folder now. I wake up to do what my artist’s motivations,
          thoughts and ideas speak to me. This is a feeling every artist in the
          world should have the opportunity to feel, the sense of true freedom
          of creation. I’m honored and grateful for being part of this
          meaningful initiative and sharing my knowledge and experiences to help
          upcoming artists show their passion and grow this amazing community."

          projects. Today I am working over 15 hours a day, oh hang on, I am not
          working… I am creating what I have always wanted to create. Thanks to
          Cryptoart, I have found a new community, a new family and a new
          opportunity to build the future I have always wanted too for my
          daughter Boo. It's life changing and I am forever grateful to all the
          collectors who have believed and connected with my art and the AMAZING
          community of artists and admirers within the crypto art world. I have
          spoken to people I wouldn’t of even dreamt to speaking to, and have
          made life long friends." -{" "}

          lifetimes. It is a movement that comes from the bottom, democratizing
          art exposure and opportunities in a way that never happened before. It
          gives freedom and power to the artist and is changing a lot of lives,
          from the smallest artists to the top ones." -{" "}

          "Crypto Art has been the catalyst for me to not only resurface ideas I
          thought were once gone and forgotten, but also to dig deeper to
          uncover thoughts and feelings I would have never been comfortable
          expressing before. Finally, it feels like there's a space for digital
          artists of any distinction to have a platform for their work to be
          acknowledged. A space that encourages community and innovation amongst
          its peers like no other. A space filled with raw potential and open to
          anyone eager to explore the uncharted path. A truly exciting moment in
          art." -{" "}
