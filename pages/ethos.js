        and 501(c)3 non-profit organization with a mission to spotlight emerging
        artists and share their creativity with the world.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since its inception, digital art as a medium has not received the
        respect or renown it deserves in the traditional fine art world. We
        believe this paradigm is at a crucial tipping point with the advent of
        blockchain technology designed to allow digital creations to be securely
        authenticated, sold and owned.
        <br />
        <br />
        A talented and intrepid cast of artists have already entered the world
        of NFTs and are quickly establishing themselves in this burgeoning
        realm. As the space rapidly matures, the breadth of opportunity is
        expanding; the NFT community is primed to welcome more creative people
        and have them embrace the opportunity at hand.
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently, the available resources for artists looking to become
        informed and take their first steps into this world are scattered,
        daunting, and expensive. Sevens Foundation will provide these tools and
        initial fundings to newcomers who are eager to participate and jump
        start their journey exploring their passion for creativity.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sevens Foundation understands and shares the concerns regarding
        blockchains' carbon footprint; this will be resolved in the near future
        on a systemic level when platforms migrate to scalable solutions. In the
        meantime we will offset the emissions produced by each and every NFT we
        mint by planting trees in partnership with{" "}
        <span className="text-grey remove-a pointer">The Gold Standard</span>
        . We are also deeply committed to equality and will focus on promoting
        and advancing the creative output of the BIPOC and LGBTQ+ communities.
        <br />
        <br />
        We believe in a bright future for artistry across the globe, and we are
        excited to welcome others into this new era through our shared passion
        for art, music, and design.
